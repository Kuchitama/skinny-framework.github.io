## FactoryGirl

<hr/>
### Easy-to-use Fixture Tool
<hr/>

Though Skinny's FactoryGirl is not a complete port of [thoughtbot/factory_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl), this module is quite useful when testing your apps.

FactoryGirl is a part of Skinny ORM, so you can use FactoryGirl even in your Play2 apps!

Just add skinny-ORM to your apps.

```
libraryDependencies += "org.skinny-framework" %% "skinny-orm" % "<%= @skinny_version %>"
```

<hr/>
### Usage
<hr/>

FactoryGirl's usage is very simple.

- Defining `SkinnyCRUDMapper`
- Append definitions to `factories.conf`

Example code:

```java
case class Company(id: Long, name: String)
object Company extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Company] {
  def extract ...
}
case class Member ...
object Member extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Member] ...
case class Country ...
object Country extends SkinnyCRUDMapper[Country] ...


val company1 = FactoryGirl(Company).create()
val company2 = FactoryGirl(Company).create('name -> "FactoryPal, Inc.")

val country = FactoryGirl(Country, 'countryyy).create()

val memberFactory = FactoryGirl(Member).withVariables('countryId -> country.id)
val member = memberFactory.create('companyId -> company1.id, 'createdAt -> DateTime.now)
```

In this example, `src/test/resources/factories.conf` is like this:

```
countryyy {
  name="Japan"
}
member {
  countryId="#{countryId}"
}
company {
  name="FactoryGirl, Inc."
}
name {
  first="Kazuhiro"
  last="Sera"
}
skill {
  name="Scala Programming"
}
```

<hr/>
### Methods

You should be aware that FactoryGirl has the following two methods.

<hr/>
### withVariables

Attributes passed to this method will be used for replacing variables such as "#{userId}" in factories.conf.

```java
/* factories.conf
member {
  name="Alice"
  countryId="#{cntId}"
}
 */
FactoryGirl(Member).withVariables(
  'cntId -> FactoryGirl(Country).create().id).create()

// will use name: Alice, countryId: 234
```

<hr/>
### withAttributes

These attributes will overwrite the values in factories.conf. 

```java
/* factories.conf
member {
  name="Alice"
  country="USA"
}
 */
FactoryGirl(Member).withAttributes('country -> "Japan").create()
// will use name: Alice, country: Japan

FactoryGirl(Member).create('country -> "Japan")
// do the same thing!
```
