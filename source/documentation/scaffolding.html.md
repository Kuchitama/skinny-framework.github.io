## Scaffolding

<hr/>
### Scaffold Generator
<hr/>

Skinny has a powerful scaffold generator. Usage is very simple.

```
./skinny g scaffold members member name:String "nickname:String:varchar(64)" birthday:Option[LocalDate]
./skinny db:migrate
./skinny run
```

Now you can use CRUD pages for members resource at `http://localhost:8080/members`.

<hr/>
#### Parameters

Scaffold command's parameters are ...

```
./skinny g scaffold:{template} {resources} {resource} "{fieldName:paramType(:columnType)}" ...
```

- {template}: "ssp" / "scaml" / "jade" (Scalate template name)
- {resources}: Resource name in the plural (camelCase)
- {resource}: Resource name (camelCase)
- {fieldName}: Field name in the resource (camelCase)
- {paramType}: `skinny.ParamType`. see also: [skinny/ParamType.scala](https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/blob/develop/common/src/main/scala/skinny/ParamType.scala)
- {columnType}: (optional) Database column type. This will be embedded into DB migration file.

<hr/>
#### Example Usage
<hr/>

Let's create a CRUD pages for project members!

<hr/>

```
$ ./skinny g scaffold:jade projectMembers projectMember name:String "nickname:Option[String]:varchar(32)" joinedAt:DateTime leaveAt:Option[DateTime]

<hr/>
After that, do DB migration.
<hr/>

```
$ ./skinny db:migrate

```

<hr/>
Run the Skinny app and access `http://localhost:8080/project_members` from your browser.
<hr/>

```
$ ./skinny run
```

<hr/>
#### URL / Parameter Names
<hr/>

The following is an example controller generated by scaffold command.

Be aware of these rules:

- Base URL will be snake_cased. If you'd like to change it, edit `resourcesBasePath`
- Parameter names will be snake_cased. `useSnakeCasedParamKeys` should be true when using `Params#withDateTime`

It'll be the fastest way to understand actual files generated by scaffold generator.

<hr/>

```java
package controller

import skinny._
import skinny.validator._
import model.ProjectMember

object ProjectMembersController extends SkinnyResource with ApplicationController {
  protectFromForgery()

  override def model = ProjectMember
  override def resourcesName = "projectMembers"
  override def resourceName = "projectMember"

  override def resourcesBasePath = s"/${toSnakeCase(resourcesName)}"
  override def useSnakeCasedParamKeys = true

  override def createForm = validation(createParams,
    paramKey("name") is required & maxLength(512),
    paramKey("nickname") is maxLength(512),
    paramKey("joined_at") is required & dateTimeFormat,
    paramKey("leave_at") is dateTimeFormat
  )
  override def createParams = Params(params).withDateTime("joined_at").withDateTime("leave_at")
  override def createFormStrongParameters = Seq(
    "name" -> ParamType.String,
    "nickname" -> ParamType.String,
    "joined_at" -> ParamType.DateTime,
    "leave_at" -> ParamType.DateTime
  )

...
```

<hr/>
### Reverse Scaffold Generator
<hr/>

If you're working with existing database, `reverse-scaffold` command is pretty useful.

When you have `project_members` table in database,

```sql
-- For H2 Database
create table project_members (
  member_id bigserial not null primary key,
  name varchar(512) not null,
  nickname varchar(32),
  joined_at timestamp not null,
  leave_at timestamp
);
```

Run the `reverse-scaffold` command like this.

This command uses DB settings in the `src/main/resources/application.conf`.

Default SkinnyEnv is `development`. If you need specifying others, add it as the fourth parameter.

```
$ ./skinny g reverse-scaffold:scaml project_members projectMembers projectMember

[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/seratch/.sbt/0.13/plugins
[info] Loading project definition from /home/project
[info] Set current project to dev (in build file:/home/)
[info] Generating /home/task/target/scala-2.10/resource_managed/main/rebel.xml.
[info] Running TaskRunner generate:reverse-scaffold:scaml project_members projectMembers projectMember

 *** Skinny Reverse Engineering Task ***

  Table     : project_members
  ID        : memberId

  Columns:
   - name:String:varchar(512)
   - nickname:Option[String]:varchar(32)
   - joinedAt:DateTime
   - leaveAt:Option[DateTime]

[success] Total time: 1 s, completed Mar 2, 2014 1:09:16 AM
```

The DB migration file generated by this command is commented out by default, so `./skinny db:migrate` will do nothing.

Just run `./skinny run` and access `http://localhost:8080/project_members` from your browser.

<hr/>
#### Parameters

Scaffold command's parameters are ...

```
./skinny g reverse-scaffold:{template} {tableName} {resources} {resource} {skinnyEnv}"
```

- {template}: "ssp" / "scaml" / "jade" (Scalate template name)
- {tableName}: Target table name in the existing database
- {resources}: Resource name in the plural (camelCase)
- {resource}: Resource name (camelCase)
- {skinnyEnv}: (optional) default value is "development"
